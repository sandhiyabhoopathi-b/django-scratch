MVT : - stand for Model View Template
    This concept explains how a web application works and interacts with a client

Model : 
    This part is responsible for processing data.
    It represents how our data is structured,stored and retrived. 
    Simply it deals with the database part of our application.

View :
    This part is responsible for handling the user interactions with our application.
    And the view is where we take user requests, process them, and send back responses.
    Simply it deals with the logic part of our application.

Template :
    This part is deal with the user interface or what the user actually sees.
    It includes the HTML markup with placeholders for different dynamic component we can add from the view parts of our application

So the MVT divides the responsibilities of our web application into three parts.
The model for managing data, the view for doing logic and the template for user interface rendering
