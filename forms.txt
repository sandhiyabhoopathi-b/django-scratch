Forms :
    Forms are used to take input from the user.
    Usually we want to take this input and store it in our database.
    And Django makes it very simple to use forms and models together to get user information and store it.

Creating forms is very similar to creating models, but instead of inheriting from the model class, we're going to be inheriting 
from the form class
    from django import forms
