Model : 
    create models, we're going to be using classes that inherit from the django model class.
    Now we're going to define different attributes . So each attributes we define is going to correspond to a column in our database.
    To actually create this table, we need to make what is called migrations.

Migrations :
    It is a process that converts whatever changes we make in the model.py file to our actual database.
    To make migrations in our application
        1. python manage.py makemigrations
        2. python manage.py migrate
    When we ran our application, a file called db.sqlite3 was created 
    This is where all our models are going to be stored 

Django by default uses SQLite database which ia a lightweight serverless database but Django also supports other database

once created our model we have to registered our model to the admin site 
    from .models import modelname
    admin.site.register(modelname)
