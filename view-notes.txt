In django, there are two ways to create a view 
    1. function-based view
    2. class-based view

function-based view :
    we define a function and give it a name and as a parameter . we're going to pass in request.
    Eg:  def hello_world(request):
    -> where request is an object that is sent by the user when they're using our application
    And when the user goes to our view , we want to return something. so what we're going to return is an HTTP response.
    so in out function going to return an HTTP response and in parenthesis we're going to pass in what we want to return.
    Eg: return HttpResponse("hello World")

class-based view:
    In order to use a class-based view, we need to work with inheritance.
    First we need to do is import the view class which we're going to be inheriting from django.views import View 
    Now we're going to define our class 
    Eg: class HelloEthiopia(View):
          def get(self,request):
            return HttpResponse("Hello Ethiopia)
